## MongoDB

The following paragraphs are for using *MongoDB* while running the server. No *MongoDB* installation is needed for running tests.

### Local use
A local use of this application and MongoDB is possible without editing the application's configuration if you don't need to authenticate yourself for using MongoDB.
If you need to authenticate, create an environement variable called `MONGODB_ADDON_URI` containing you mongo connection URI (see [this page](http://www.mongoing.com/docs/reference/connection-string.html)).
Enjoy, the database used is *cloud* if you don't set your own URI and the collection edited is named *users*
